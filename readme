This is the repository for Noah LSM version 2.7.GFS from the current FV3GFS

It contains the complete, selfcontained Noah LSM source code file (except the driver, all other subroutines (sflx.f, set_soilveg.f,
module_sfc_diff.f) are copied from the GFSV16), input control file, input atmospheric forcing file, and example execution-time LSM output
files for a full one-year 1998 simulation. This simulation is valid at the Champaign, Illinois surface-flux site (40.01 N, 88.37 W) of
NOAA/ARL investigator Tilden Meyers.
